# skebstore

A very primitive alternative extension installer for Skiovox users with the Web Store blocked.
## How to use Skebstore

1. Go to (https://github.com/bypassiwastaken/skebstore)
2. Click the green Code button, and then click Download as Zip
3. Go into your file manager (on a chromebook open chrome://file-manager), right click the zip file, and click extract all
4. go to (chrome://extensions/). On the right top corner turn on developer mode. 
5. On the top left click Load unpacked
6. In the file selection that opens up, find the folder called skebstore-master. **IMPORTANT:** go into this folder (call it folder 1). Inside, if there are multiple folders, just go back and select folder 1, click open at the bottom. If there is just one folder inside called (once again) skebstore-master, (some zip extractors do this) then use this folder instead. 
8. If the installer page does not show up, click on the extentions icon on the top right of the chrome navbar, and click on the newly installed skebstore extention
9. Paste the ID of the extention you want to install into skebstore.
Pull requests and improvements are appreciated.


For example, we need to:
- Add an icon
- Add code to style.css
